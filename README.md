# Capture-the-Flag-War-Game
•	The war game uses Linux terminal commands to answer questions in a “Capture the Flag” (CTF) style format 

•	The game runs as a shell script. 

•	The script sets up the challenge environment by creating user accounts, directories, and files; by setting permissions and passwords; once the script completes execution, the puzzles can be attempted. 

•	The shell script can be copied onto any Linux system, executed, and then the challenges can be attempted. Script creates four challenges of increasing difficulty (one easy; one moderate difficulty; and one difficult).
